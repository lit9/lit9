{"name":"Lit9","tagline":"","body":"### **What is Lit9**\r\nLit9 is an open source human computer interface; its main goal is to interact with a Linux system using a standard TV remote control as an input device.\r\nIt is based on LIRC and it uses standard Xlib native functions to simulate mouse and keyboard (by means of predictive text technology) on the X Window System. \r\nIt currently works on Ubuntu 9.x/10.x; it is tested with a standard MCE Kit (remote control and receiver) and with a generic remote control (Toshiba_CT-90287-TV), with USB-UIRT2 as receiver.\r\n\r\n### **Software requirements**\r\nTo compile and run the current version of LIT 9 you should have Ubuntu 9.04, 9.10, 10.04 or 10.10.\r\nThe main packages and libraries you need to install are:\r\n* dialog\r\n* libqt4-dev\r\n* libqt4-core\r\n* libqt4-gui\r\n* libsqlite3-dev\r\n* lirc\r\n\r\nThe command you have to write in the shell to do everything in only one instruction is:\r\n\r\n`sudo apt-get install dialog libqt4-dev libqt4-core libqt4-gui libsqlite3-dev lirc`\r\n\r\nOr if there are any kind of problems:\r\n\r\n    `sudo apt-get install dialog`\r\n    `sudo apt-get install libqt4-dev`\r\n    `sudo apt-get install libqt4-core`\r\n    `sudo apt-get install libqt4-gui`\r\n    `sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev`\r\n    `sudo apt-get install lirc`\r\n\r\n### **Other files needed**\r\nInside /usr/share/lirc/ you have the configuration files of all remote controls you can use with lirc. We tested our system on a generic MCE (Windows Media Center) remote control with its relative receiver. \r\nThe configuration of the buttons we used is easily reachable with this path:\r\n\r\n     `gedit /usr/share/lirc/remotes/mceusb/lircd.conf.mceusb`\r\n\r\nTo use it you have to edit a file called hardware.conf:\r\n\r\n     `gedit /etc/lirc/hardware.conf`\r\n\r\nwhich must looks like this:\r\n\r\n`TRANSMITTER=\"Microsoft Windows Media Center V2 (usb) : Direct TV Receiver\"`\r\n`TRANSMITTER_MODULES=\"lirc_dev mceusb\"`\r\n`TRANSMITTER_DRIVER=\"\"`\r\n`TRANSMITTER_DEVICE=\"\"`\r\n`TRANSMITTER_SOCKET=\"\"`\r\n`TRANSMITTER_LIRCD_CONF=\"directtv/general.conf\"`\r\n`TRANSMITTER_LIRCD_ARGS=\"\"`\r\n`START_LIRCD=\"true\"`\r\n`START_LIRCMD=\"\"`\r\n`LOAD_MODULES=\"\"`\r\n`LIRCMD_CONF=\"\"`\r\n`FORCE_NONINTERACTIVE_RECONFIGURATION=\"false\"`\r\n`REMOTE=\"Windows Media Center Transceivers/Remotes (all)\"`\r\n`REMOTE_MODULES=\"lirc_dev mceusb\"`\r\n`REMOTE_DRIVER=\"\"`\r\n`REMOTE_DEVICE=\"/dev/lirc0\"`\r\n`REMOTE_SOCKET=\"\"`\r\n`REMOTE_LIRCD_CONF=\"mceusb/lircd.conf.mceusb\"`\r\n`REMOTE_LIRCD_ARGS=\"\" `\r\n\r\nIf you want you can download this file and the one used for Toshiba_CT-90287-TV remote control with USB-UIRT2 as receiver you can visit: LiT9 Wiki\r\n\r\n### **A simple test**\r\nTo test if everithing goes well you only have to connect the receiver to your computer and write this in the shell:\r\n\r\n`name@pc-name:~$ irw`\r\n\r\nnow if you press any button on the remote control you should see something like this:\r\n\r\n`name@pc-name:~$ 000000037ff07bfe 00 One mceusb`\r\n`name@pc-name:~$ 000000037ff07bfd 00 Two mceusb`\r\n`name@pc-name:~$ 000000037ff07bfc 00 Three mceusb`\r\n\r\n### **Donwload and Install**\r\nLast stable version tested and the user manual are available on: Download section\r\n\r\nTo extract files:\r\n\r\n`name@pc-name:~$ tar xvzf lit9_vX.X.tar.gz\r\nname@pc-name:~$ cd lit9_vX.X`\r\n\r\n### **Notes**\r\nWith other remote controls and receivers you have to download the lirc package which is on: http://www.lirc.org/ and also to see which is the right configuration for your system. \r\nRead the INSTALL file inside the package to start the configuration. The main variable you have to set are: \r\n\r\n`REMOTE_MODULES (modules to let your receiver talk with your pc) `\r\n`REMOTE_LIRCD_CONF (where is the configuration of your remote control)`\r\n\r\n### **About us**\r\nThe software is taken from a student project, it is developed at the University of Messina (Italy), Faculty of Engineering by students enrolled in Master Studies in Computer Engineering and supervised by Visilab (Computer Vision and Human Computer Interaction Laboratory).\r\n\r\n### **Contact us**\r\n* Davide Mulfari: davidemulfari@gmail.com\r\n* Nicola Peditto: n.peditto@gmail.com\r\n* Carmelo Romeo: carmelo.romeo85@gmail.com\r\n* Fabio Verboso: fabio.verboso@gmail.com","google":"UA-21030874-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
